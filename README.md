## SSL Logs Analysis
This project listens to SSL logs via certstream and is catching potential phishing websites, by comparing their domains to ones generated by dnstwister.
This project was written in Python 3.12.3.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/mcqq1/SSL-logs-analysis.git
```

2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies.
```
cd SSL-logs-analysis
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Files that are meant to be runned are:
1. ```run_client.py```
  This script activates the client (the one who takes url and checks it with 'is_phishing' function). When runned it should display ```Consumer is ready to receive data...```
2. ```run_server.py```
  This script activates the server (the one who sends urls fetched via certstream to client.). When runned with client activated, it should print current url it is sending.
3. ```scan.py```
  This is a helper script. It's just a simple Virus Total API integration, to further verificate potential phishing websites.
